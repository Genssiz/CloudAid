Guidelines for Documenting Data Sets: DATA SET INFORMATION

The purpose of this page is to provide detailed information on a particular
data set to enable other researchers to use the data for a variety of analysis 
tasks. For example, a data page might describe census data which could then be
used for different analysis tasks such as classification or clustering.

When filling out this form, simply place your answer after the point indicated
by '>'. We will then process the form to ensure that all documentation files 
follow a common format.


1. Title of Data Set
   -- Indicate the central topic of the domain.
>

2. Data Type
   -- Indicate the type of data: multivariate, relational, time seris, 
      sequential, images, spatial, text, time series, transactional, web data
   -- If the data is heterogenous, list all relevant types.
>

3. Abstract
   -- A short one or two sentence description of the data (for use in summary 
      pages).
>

4. Sources
   (a) Original owners of database (name/snail address/phone/email/homepage)
>
   (b) Donor of database (name/snail address/phone/email/homepage)
>

5. Data Characteristics
   -- Describe how and why the data was collected.
   -- Provide the date and location of the data collection.
        -- distinguish between single and multiple times/locations 
   -- Describe the nature of the data. For example, are the
      data physical measurements, derived variables, from an opinion
      poll, etc.
   -- Are there any known systematic biases in the measurements? (e.g.,
      camera characteristics for image data)
   -- Did the data arise from:
        (i) observational data (i.e. data collected routinely)
       (ii) designed experiment
      (iii) designed sampling strategy
       (iv) census, (i.e. the data collected on all individuals/objects)
        (v) other, (please describe)
   -- Was the data preprocessed? if so, describe the preprocessing.
    
   -- Include any other information that you believe is important.
>

   -- Depending on the data type, also describe the following:

   All Types:
     (a) Missing Values:
         -- where possible describe why the values are missing
         -- missing at random, missing not at random, not applicable,
            unknown, don't cares 
>
     (b) Dependencies: are there any known dependencies between cases. For 
         example, do instances represent the same object viewed from different 
         angles.
>

   Multivariate:
     (a) for each variable (feature/attribute/field):
           (i) give a name 
          (ii) provide typing information (i.e. is the variable categorical
               (ordered, unordered) or continuous).
               -- Be careful to distinguish categorical values that have been
                  encoded numerically.
         (iii) if the variable is categorical, list and describe the possible 
               values it may take on.
>

   Text:
     (a) language: (e.g. english, french, spanish,...)
>
     (b) annotated: are the data annotated and if so with what information?
>
     (c) structured: is the text structured in any manner (e.g. is the
         text html, or email) 
>
     (d) preprocessing: case, punctuation, stoplisted


6. Other Relevant Information
   -- Include any additional information about the data that the researcher 
      may find useful. (Note there is a separate document for including
      task specific information.) For example:

      Prior Knowledge
        -- Describe the types of prior knowledge that could be used, 
           (provide references if possible). For example:  
           (i) transformations of the data
           (ii) class hierarchies
           (iii) known relevant and irrelevant variables
           (iv) constraints: e.g. variables could be positive or restricted
                to a certain range.

7. Data Format
   -- Describe how the data is stored in the archive. List the files, their
      contents, and their format (if not in plain text).
   -- Please describe thoroughly any data formats used which are unlikely
      to be known by non specialists. If necessary, use a separate file
      to describe the format.
   -- If there are different versions of the data, please describe the
      differences. For example, are there specific training and test
      sets that commonly used in the literature. 
>

8. Past Usage
    -- Include references that discuss the data itself and how it was 
       collected. These references could be either classic and widely
       cited papers that were the first to announce the data and its 
       characteristics, or possibly a domain specific web site.

  (b) usage restrictions (e.g. for reseach only)
>
  (c) citation requests
>
  (d) acknowledgements

10. References & Further Information
  -- Include here references to additional information that describes the
     data itself. (Note there is another document for references that describe
     analyses of the data).
  (a) pointers to tutorial/background information on the domain
  (b) other useful web sites (parent archives, domain specific sites)
